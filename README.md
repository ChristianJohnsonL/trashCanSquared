Trash Can Disguised Trash Can

Have you ever wanted a trash can that actually looks like a trash can?

Well now you can, with trashCan²! Great for offices, workshops, bathrooms, bedrooms, kitchens, makerspaces, you name it!

Scale it to your heart’s content. As long as all parts are scaled equally, the lid dowel should hold the lid hinge in place with a press fit. If the fit ends up a little loose, a small amount of superglue applied to the bottom of the lid dowel will lock it in.

The model is designed to minimize the need for supports. I recommend printing the lid top oriented face-up to avoid supports altogether and keep the surface clean. You are, however going to need supports for the inside of the lid. 

The version shown here is sized to make full use of the build volume of the Bambu Lab P2S. Print time for the body alone was roughly 7 days, so yeah,  this is not a quick print. For best results and actual usability as a trash can, I recommend:

Infill: 25% or higher

Wall count: 4 or more

The wheels are designed to accept standard skateboard-size ball bearings, which press-fit directly into the model. This fit is only guaranteed at the default scale. Scaling the model up or down will require either remixing the body geometry  or creating an adapter to maintain proper bearing tolerances.
